Please make notes here to clarify any decisions taken that you wish to communicate.

## Thoughts
- Consider using redis for repeated calls with same string (cache it with a time to live options)
- Consider using data base to store the stats
- Concider handling the race condition with lock for stats 
- concider creating swagger instead of '/' route to send information about the endpoints.
- Refered docs from greeks for greeks and used github copilot
